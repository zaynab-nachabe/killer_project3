# killer_project3
This repository contains the codebase for our multiplayer chat-based game project inspired by "Le Killer". The main focus of the project is to implement a server-client architecture using Python sockets, with the game functionality being secondary.

Objective:

The objective of our project is to develop a multiplayer game where players interact via a chat server. Each player is assigned a "deadly" word by the moderator, and the goal is to trick other players into typing their deadly word. The last player standing wins the game.

Features:

    Server-client architecture using Python sockets.
    Implementation of game mechanics such as assigning deadly words, player interactions, and game state management.
    Command-line interface for both server and client applications.
    Error handling and fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure smooth gameplay.

Collaboration:

This project is a collaborative effort involving Zaynab Nachabe, Justin Diter and Jack Massey. We have worked (will work) together to design, implement, and test the features of the game.

Instructions for Contributors:

Contributors are encouraged to review the existing codebase, propose enhancements or bug fixes, and submit pull requests for review.
